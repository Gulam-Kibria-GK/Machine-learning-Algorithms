# Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository contains practical Jupyter Notebook implementations of foundational Machine Learning algorithms. The code is designed to help learners understand how these algorithms work by implementing them manually, from scratch, without relying heavily on machine learning libraries.


## Why This Repository?

To truly understand machine learning, it's important to go beyond just using libraries like `scikit-learn`. This repository helps you:

- Understand ML concepts by building algorithms line by line
- Explore learning behavior through visualizations and toy datasets
- Gain confidence by reading and modifying working code
- Prepare for interviews or exams with hands-on algorithm knowledge


## What You Will Find

Each notebook:

- Focuses on a specific ML algorithm or evaluation metric
- Implements the algorithm using Python and NumPy
- Contains step-by-step explanations and comments
- Visualizes the learning or prediction process when possible

## How to Use These Notebooks

- Clone the repository:  
  `git clone https://github.com/GK-CPP/Machine-learning-Algorithms.git`

- Open the folder in Jupyter:  
  `jupyter notebook`

- Install required libraries (if needed):  
  `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn`

- Open any `.ipynb` file to view, run, and modify the algorithm interactively

- Try running on new datasets or tweak parameters to learn by doing


## Learning Tips

- Don’t just run the code — read the logic behind each step
- Use toy datasets to clearly observe how each algorithm works
- Compare your implementation to `sklearn` for verification
- Break the code on purpose to see how errors occur and how to fix them
- Try converting notebook logic to functions or modules for practice
